Explanation
What is the current row?

If table visual is:

| Product: A |
| Product: B |

Each row has an existing filter:

Row 1 → Product = A
Row 2 → Product = B

Inside the row:

CALCULATE enforces context transition.

So the measure becomes:

Row 1 → SUM(Sales Amount WHERE Product=A)
Row 2 → SUM(Sales Amount WHERE Product=B)

🎯 Learning

Even though we wrote only:

CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]))


CALCULATE automatically reads the current values of columns in that row and converts them into filters.

This is Context Transition.
