LESSON 1: Measures vs Calculated Columns — The Foundation

📌 What is a Calculated Column?

Calculated row by row

Stored in the model

Used for categories, slicers, grouping

Example:
Age Category =
IF( Employees[Age] > 40, "Senior", "Junior" )


This will evaluate each row and store the result permanently.

📌 What is a Measure?

Calculated on the fly

Not stored

Used for:
✔ Aggregations
✔ KPIs
✔ Calculations depending on filters in visuals

Example:
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])
This changes depending on which:

Month is selected
Region is selected
Product is selected



# Example of MEasure
total_revenue = sum(Sales[SalesAmount])

# calculate is unnecesary , only needed when you want to change filter context.

# Example of calculated column
Revenueperunit = Sales[SalesAmount] / Sales[Qty]
