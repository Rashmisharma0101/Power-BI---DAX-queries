LESSON 2: Row Context vs Filter Context (the heart of DAX)

🧠 ROW CONTEXT

Row context = DAX looks at one row at a time.

This exists in:

✔ Calculated Columns
✔ Iterators (SUMX, AVERAGEX, FILTER etc.)

Example (calculated column):

Profit = Sales[SalesAmount] - Sales[Cost]


DAX goes row by row:

Amount	Cost	Profit
200	150	50
300	200	100
500	300	200

That is row context.

🎯 FILTER CONTEXT

Filter context = filters coming from:

✔ slicers
✔ visual
✔ page filters
✔ report filters
✔ CALCULATE()

Example:

Total Revenue = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])


If the user selects:

Product = “A”

Region = “India”

Year = 2023

The measure will only sum those rows.

That's filter context.

🌟 Why CALCULATE() is god-level?

Because CALCULATE changes filter context.

Example:

Total Revenue All Products =
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]),
    ALL(Sales[Product])
)

This removes the product filter.
# calculate  - is overpowering on filters applied
